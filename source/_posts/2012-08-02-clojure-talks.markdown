It has been awhile since my last post, life has been quite busy (as
 always). I thought that I should share some of the great Clojure
 themed talks that I have been consuming in my down time.

* [Dynamic Pricing through DSLs](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-runa-dynamic-pricing-through-DSLs) 
  This talk by Amit Rathore takes an great approach to DSLs. His
  company Runa uses a DSL to alleviate the pains of enterprise
  customisation's to their product.
  
* [Why Prismatic Goes Faster With Clojure](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Why-Prismatic-Goes-Faster-With-Clojure)
  This talk shows that Clojure can be *FAST*. I wish these libraries
  were open-source so that I could get a look at their inner
  workings.
  
* [Reducers - Rich Hickey](http://vimeo.com/45561411)
  I saved the best for last. This is the best talk I have watched in
  awhile. Rich does a great job of walking through reducers and
  explaining why they are important. I keep meaning to download the
  Clojure 1.5 beta and try these out for myself. In the Clojure
  programming that I have done it seems that the majority of maps and
  filters are not order dependent and therefore could greatly benefit
  from the use of reducers.
