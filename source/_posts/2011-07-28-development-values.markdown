What ideals should one value most when making career decisions?

This is a hard question (and I'm sure is a good candidate for spuring debate). I was recently placed in a postition which recquired to internally choose the values I strive for in my career. By values I am refering to the things which motivate you; make you excited for work; give your life value. Some people will be motivated by money, others will value a flexible working schedule. The possibilites for motivations are endless and completely personal.

So what do I value? After much reflection, my number one value is personal growth. I need to be learning, constantly. I need to have challanges. I have had multiple long term jobs (not all of which are IT releated, but long term none-the-less), there is nothing more depressing than the feeling of being stuck in a rut. Personal challange is not my only value, money is a present value. I wouldn't consider money a determining value for job choice, I just like to be able to provide for my family.
