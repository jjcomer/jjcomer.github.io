I had been thinking about the parsing code I initially written for [TodoClj](http://jjcomer.github.com/TodoClj) I remembered that I had initially set out to mimics [Todo.txt](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli), so I have reoriented and now I am parsing the same format accepted by Todo.txt.

{% include_code TodoClj Clojure/coreV2.clj %}

I feel that I am getting more and more comfortable with using clojure. I have stopped using Eclipse and instead use Sublime Text 2 and the REPL provided by lein for my project.
